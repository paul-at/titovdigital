      <h2>Brief</h2>
      <p><a href="http://bootcamp.mit.edu">MIT Bootcamps</a> team was scaling up and needed to automate
        processing of student applications.</p>

      <p>Spreadsheets were used to handle admissions process historically and with 1000+ applicants for each
        new class convolution of the process accumulated exponentially, resulting in
        occasional loss of application data.</p>

      <p>Existing off-the-shelf options were considered
        did not support voting on decisions,
        implemented different admissions process
        and annual cost quoted was as much as a new custom development.
      </p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>A back-office web application implementing pre-existing student admissions workflow
        has been created and deployed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="kpis"><div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <big>3x</big>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <big>2x</big>
          increase of student applications that have been accepted and paid tuition
          <span class="text-muted">(per class)</span>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <big>100%</big>
          data consistency

      </div>
    </div></div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <p>Main screen displays overview of a class, visualising how many students are on each
        of the application stage currently.</p>

      <figure class="figure">

      <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>The first column provides summary into the class composition and admissions process status,
          showing number of applicants and how many have committed to attend.
          Remaining columns show applications in various stages and overall pipeline:
          how many reached screening stage, how many went past to interviewing stage and how many
          admissions decisions were made for the class.</p>

        <p>System users also use Today screen to view pending applications that are ready to be actioned.</p>
        <figure class="figure">

        <p>Admissions system ensures that state transition follow predefined process,
          using <a href="states.svg">state diagram</a>
          that has beed defined with the admissions team
          during analysis.</p>

        </figure>
      </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Application Form</h2>

      <p>Application forms filled on the website are sent to the admission system
        right away using its REST API. The form is editable and permits seeing
        everything that has been happening with the application in one place:
        personal data, current status, voting results, interview notes, payments.</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Consensus Student Review</h2>

      <p>Two different voting mechanisms were built to support decision-making
        at various stages.</p>

      <p>Initially, applications are being reviewed by a few members of the team,
        who vote on whether it should proceed forward based on the application content.
        The vote is a simple yes/no and the application is allowed to proceed to
        a next stage &mdash; interviewing or rejection &mdash; only when a consensus
        is reached, having at least half of the admissions committee for the class
        in agreement.</p>

      <p>After interview, each applicant scored using one to five scale
        on a number of criteria,
        defined for each class. The scoring can be done by any member of
        the admissions committee and assigned interviewer, and resulting
        average score can later be used to admit or reject applicant,
        as well as part of decision-making for scholarship.</p>

      <h2>Find Previous Applications</h2>

      <p>The system automatically looks up previous applications
        by name, email or phone number and cross-references application forms.</p>

      <p>By storing all the applications in a database, admissions team were able
        to track who had applied before in the past.
        When track was kept using spreadsheets,
        the team had to rely on memory of the most senior member.</p>

      <h2>Interview Scheduling and Note-Taking</h2>

      <p>Interviews are assigned to an interviewer, and a rich-text editor
        is available for interviewers to take their notes. The notes stored
        for each interviewer individually and made available to the rest of the team.</p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">List of applicants that reched interviewing stage.</figcaption>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>Scholarship and Payments</h2>

      <p>Users can set up multiple payment tiers for each class.
        Each payment tier consists of deposit and tuition fee.
        Applications can be assigned to different payment tiers manually to allow for
        discounts or different 'packages'.</p>

      <p>Each payment made by applicant is entered into the system.</p>

      <p>Based on the value paid admitted applicants are automatically
        progressed to <em>Deposit Paid</em> and <em>Tuition Paid</em> states,
        allowing for quick reporting on pending payments.</p>

      <p>Scholarship candidates are counted separately, with application able
        to progress through <em>Scholarship Shortlisted</em> state into
        <em>Scholarship Granted</em>, meaning the applicant has tuition fee waived,
        or <em>Scholarship Rejected</em>, allowing the applicant to pay
        normal tuition price or decide not to come.</p>

            for applicants who have been interviewed for a class.</figcaption>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h2>E-Mail Automation</h2>

      <p>
      Admissions System has an option to create an instant mailing list
      by class and application state. The e-mail can be controlled in granular
      fashion by selection applicants from the list who will receive the message
      and enter arbitrary e-mails for sending copies.
      </p>

      <p>Automatic e-mail rules can be set up to send a template once
        application reaches a certain state &mdash; such as being selected
        for interviewing or rejected.</p>

      <p>A wide selection of merge tags is available and all sent e-mails
        are archived in relevant application form history.</p>
  
      <h2>Access Controls</h2>

      <p>Application offers granular access control, allowing to configure
        <em>Administrators</em> who are allowed full access and
        <em>Staff Members</em> who are permitted to access only those classes
        in which they are members of the admissions committee.</p>

      <h2>Interoperability</h2>

      <p>The application has CSV import and export options that were used
        to import past application data from legacy spreadsheet (to show them
        in past applications), connect the system to marketing automation tools
        such as HubSpot or MailChip, and export data for future analysis.</p>
