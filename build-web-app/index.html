            Contracting web application development is a perilous task.
            There is always uncertainty whether the result will function
            and appear as desired; whether the deadlines will be met;
            and the biggest risk, whether the entire application would have to be redone
            because of a scoping mistake.
          </p>
          <p class="text-light">
            There is a saying in project management that for each project cost, time
            and scope are mutually exclusive. However, with the right execution the
            characteristics of the result are predetermined and can be relied upon.
            Titov Digital uses a four-step web application delivery pipeline
            that eliminates the uncertainty risks.

          <p>
            A well designed web application makes a process five to ten times faster for users,
            enabling new customer and employee interactions.
            For example:
          </p>

          <p>
              <strong>Simple access to information.</strong>
                A web application helps customers and employees to interact
                with the data by eliminating manual form processing.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Data analysis.</strong>
              A web application collects vast amounts of user data automatically
              and processes them continiously, uncovering insights that are hard or impractical
              to discover using manual reporting.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ease of interaction and Scale.</strong>
            Automating a manual process allow to reach larger audience,
            and guiding customer interactions inside an app makes them more
            likely to engage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Data integrity.</strong>
            A web application enforces validity of database records
            continiously, eliminating mistakes and data losses in spreadsheets.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

          <p>
            At this step, a high-level specification is produced,
            describing the functions new application performs at the high level.
          </p>

          <p>The goal of this step is to have an understanding of how much
            resources and time each possible feature requires and select
            ones that will be included in the first version, a minimum viable product.
          </p>

          <p>Together with non-functional requirements and problem definition
            prepared in the previous step these requirements are recorded in a
            Statement of Work.

              At Titov Digital, development and user acceptance testing are conducted
              simultaneously. Each weak or fortnight, depending on the project, development
              cycle completes and the results, in a form of finished features or milestones
              are presented at a demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              The feedback from the demo is implemented the following week. This process
              closes loop between requirements and application as tightly as possible,
              permitting minor changes and improvements that couldn't have been predicted in the planning stage.
