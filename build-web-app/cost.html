            <h1>Three Major Decisions</h1>
            <h3>that Will Impact the Cost of Your New SaaS Application</h3>
          </div>

          <div class="longread">
            <h2>1. Mobile or Web Application</h2>
            <p><img src="cost/adults-casual-cellphone-1413653.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Web Application Users"></p>
            <p><strong>One of the biggest decisions new application founders face is whether to create a native mobile or web application or both.</strong></p>
            <p>Every major online brand has applications for both Android and IOS platforms.</p>
            <p>That may not always be the right choice for a new start-up. At such early stages it’s hard to tell what impact this choice will have on the founders, both technologically and financially.</p>
            <p>Sure, historically native apps were the go-to due to all the extra features they had over web apps, and because of the simple fact that the majority of apps had to be native to even operate on mobile.</p>
            <p>However, over the recent years web technology has undergone a rapid evolution, allowing web applications to do just about everything a native mobile app can do.</p>
              
            <p><strong>The proper approach to building app platforms today is web by default and mobile only when absolutely necessary.</strong></p>
            <p>The main reason for such choice in a startup environment would be app cost.</p>
            <p>The web has become a standardised environment. Mobile ecosystems however still have two incompatible OS making them a difficult  and costly platform to build on.</p>
            <p>Some of these challenges include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>frequent major releases with new devices consisting of different sizes and capabilities</li>
              <li>app stores regularly undergo change in policies and requirements</li>
              <li>vendor lock-in</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Mobile applications do have their own unique features that web applications aren’t capable of yet. They include features like sending push notifications on IOS and the ability to run hardware-demanding applications such as VR/AR and 3D rendering.</p>
            <p>Web apps have gained many capabilities that were only available to native apps previously.</p>
            <p>That doesn’t mean you should count out web apps just yet. Many features that were only native to mobile applications are now capable on web apps.</p>
            <p>Notifications work on majority of platforms: Mac, Windows and Android support them natively. Web applications can now record or stream audio and video on all platforms including mobile. Web applications have access to location and geopositioning services. </p>
            <p>They can work offline, even store large amounts of data and having complex databases in a local storage. Web apps can even have complex UI with dynamic elements that include custom styling and animations.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Unless your SaaS app requires capabilities that are only available on mobile apps, you’re better off creating your MVP as a web application that can support Android, IOS, and even Desktop simultaneously without having to build different variations of the same application.</strong></p>

            <h2>2. AWS, Heroku or DigitalOcean</h2>
            <p><img src="cost/adult-data-database-1181316.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Choosing application hosting"></p>
            <p><strong>The second most impactful decision that will affect the cost of&nbsp;your SaaS is&nbsp;in&nbsp;your choice of&nbsp;Cloud hosting infrastructure. The cost of&nbsp;hosting itself is&nbsp;miniscule.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>It&rsquo;s the amount of&nbsp;labor required to&nbsp;deploy and run the application that can carry a&nbsp;steep price.</strong></p>
            <p>Three major cloud hosting services types are available:</p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Infrastructure as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service (IaaS) providers such as&nbsp;AWS and Azure
              <dd>offer a&nbsp;scalable infrastructure such as&nbsp;virtual servers, storage, popular database servers, balancing services and so&nbsp;on.</dd>
              <dt>Virtual Private Server (VPS) providers</dt>
              <dd>specialise in&nbsp;virtual servers often preconfigured for web hosting applications. While this service may seem similar to&nbsp;IaaS, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;typically targeted to&nbsp;simple websites that have outgrown shared web hosting. It&nbsp;usually offers much greater ease of&nbsp;configuration but is&nbsp;typically used by&nbsp;users who do&nbsp;not need automatic scaling capabilities.</dd>
              <dt>Platform as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service providers such as&nbsp;Heroku</dt>
              <dd>implement application hosting services that encompass web server set&nbsp;up, staging environment management, application monitoring, logging, load balancing and more. They provide an&nbsp;automated service that replaces labour-intensive cloud infrastructure maintenance.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p><strong>Although Infrastructure as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service providers’ brands are often more recognisable, majority of&nbsp;web applications scalability and operations&rsquo; requirements are better served by&nbsp;Platform as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Service hosting providers.</strong></p>
            <p>Modern computers and frameworks are extremely fast so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not uncommon to&nbsp;run a&nbsp;database containing a&nbsp;few million rows or&nbsp;an&nbsp;application serving tens of&nbsp;thousands users simultaneously on&nbsp;just a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;servers.</p>
            <p><strong>In&nbsp;reality horizontal scaling is&nbsp;required only for niche applications with high bursts of&nbsp;extreme load: distributed scientific calculations, video transcoding and so&nbsp;on. Implementing horizontal scaling on&nbsp;IaaS platforms doesn&rsquo;t benefit the majority of&nbsp;modern web applications.</strong></p>
            <p>For example, if&nbsp;application core development cost is&nbsp;$30k, deploying and operating it&nbsp;on&nbsp;IaaS provider can cost extra $5k during the first few months, whereas making it&nbsp;scalable by&nbsp;implementing partitioned NoSQL databases, while keeping data integrity requirements may triple the cost.</p>

            <h2>3. In-house versus Outsourced Development Team</h2>
            <p><img src="cost/brainstorming-collaborate-collaboration-1204649.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Web Application Development Team"></p>
            <p><strong>Outsourced development, especially remote, is widely considered to be a no-frills low-cost option.</strong></p>
            <p>While there is truth to this point of view, reality is much more complex and real benefits of outsourced development are bigger than cost savings alone.</p>
            <p><strong>The greatest benefit an outsourced team can offer is the ability to transfer experience from similar applications made for other customers and a coherent established team to bring to the product.</strong></p>
            <p>The speed, at which learning from previous projects occurs in outsourcer environment is much faster than full-time employees with similar experience could have, due to ability to create improved architecture for each new product rather than having to work with existing legacy environment.</p>
            <p>Time to market is another consideration. </p>
            <p><strong>Hiring an in-house development team can take upwards of up to 3-6 months before it gets up to speed.</strong></p>
            <p>At this point you run the risk of some of your hires not being a good fit for your team. Not only will this prolong your speed to market but there’s also other challenges you may face such as initial architecture decisions taking longer to implement than scheduled due to a lack of recent greenfield development experience amongst the full-time developers.</p>
            <p>These challenges can result in the release of a substandard product 6-12 months after starting development.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Then why does outsourced development have reputation of higher delivery risks?</p>
            <p>Very often it is a product vision issue. Product vision, comprised of knowledge how customers would be discovering and using the application, as well as obtaining value from its use, has to remain in house. It’s very tempting to implicitly outsource this vision, the purpose of the application and its differences from existing products, by asking outsourcer to make a certain application type. This is where the disconnect occurs.</p>
            <p>Outsourcer may have created many similar apps previously. However,</p>
            <p><strong>Only the core team understands the needs and desires of the target customer, the use cases and the motivation for creating a new business intimately.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Make sure that this knowledge is communicated to guide and shape new development regardless of type of the team you choose.</strong></p>
            <p>Outsourcer should be responsible for delivery of the product. Ensuring that product-market fit is reflected in the specifications and outsourcer work would do wonders for the final results.</p>

            <h3>Key points</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Cost and time to market. Choose outsourced team based on transferable experience it can provide rather than seeing it merely as a way to save money.</li>
              <li>Keep product vision in-house to reduce delivery risks.</li>
            </ol>
